#dplyr package contains the select and filter tools we need to organize and split the file.
#need to split the file so that we only have post data, and only have CAR == 1 data
#First assign a new data frame name, then set the select arguments
#bare code should look like this:

NewData <- select(filter(OldData, GroupVar1 == 2, GroupVar2 == 1), c(variable1,variable2,variable3,...))

#Here is the code example:

TCI0316CAYRPOST <- select(filter(TCI0316, PREPOSTref == 2, CAR == 1), c(DBID, referid, PREPOSTref, CAR, CAR_Screen, CAR_CRIT))

#A new data frame will be created in R (found on the right under 'Global Environment'). You can open that data frame to make sure it looks right
#There are two participants that are excluded from analyses. To remove them, use this bare code:

NewData <- NewData[-row#, ]

#Here is the real code:

TCI0316CAYRPOST <-TCI0316CAYRPOST[-6, ]
TCI0316CAYRPOST <-TCI0316CAYRPOST[-1, ]

#Now determine frequencies by creating a frequency table.

#Here is the bare code:

NEWtable <- table(NewData$variable1)
NEWtable

#Code example:

CAYR_DIStable <- table(PostCAYR_only_data_new$CAYR_DIS)
CAYR_DIStable

#Make a table for each variable that needs frequencies computed.

#Next we need descriptive stats to determine the average drop out month. Make sure psych package is loaded
#Here is the bare code:

describe.by(NewData$variable2)

#Need to do the same analysis for the time 1 data, so input same 'select' function except this time filter for pre only

#Need to remove certain rows of data (not sure if I can combine this code, but for now I did it separately):

TCI0316CAYRPRE <-TCI0316CAYRPRE[-1, ]
TCI0316CAYRPRE <-TCI0316CAYRPRE[-2, ]
TCI0316CAYRPRE <-TCI0316CAYRPRE[-3, ]

#Next run the exact same codes as before but for the PRE data frame
