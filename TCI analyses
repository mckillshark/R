#dplyr package contains the select and filter tools we need to organize and split the file.
#need to split the file so that we only have post data, and only have CAR == 1 data
#First assign a new data frame name, then set the select arguments
#bare code should look like this:

NewData <- select(filter(OldData, GroupVar1 == 2, GroupVar2 == 1), c(variable1,variable2,variable3,...))

#Here is the code example:

TCI0316CAYRPOST <- select(filter(TCI0316, PREPOSTref == 2, CAR == 1), c(DBID, referid, PREPOSTref, CAR, CAR_Screen, CAR_CRIT))

#A new data frame will be created in R (found on the right under 'Global Environment'). You can open that data frame to make sure it looks right
#There are two participants that are excluded from analyses. To remove them, use this bare code:

NewData <- NewData[-row#, ]

#Here is the real code:

TCI0316CAYRPOST <-TCI0316CAYRPOST[-6, ]
TCI0316CAYRPOST <-TCI0316CAYRPOST[-1, ]

#Now ready to run some frequencies using count function.
#Here is the bare code (although R will indicates what to fill in)

count_(NewData, NewData$Variable1, wt = NULL, sort = FALSE)

#Here is the real code:

count_(TCI0316CAYRPOST, TCI0316CAYRPOST$CAR, wt = NULL, sort = FALSE)

#BOOM.
