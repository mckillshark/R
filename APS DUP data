# Analysis of the APS DUP data
# This was originally done in SPSS, but because SPSS is Satan's grandchild, I am doing the analysis in R
# Data cleaning was done already

# Install packages

install.packages("plyr")
library(plyr)

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

# Data organization- keep only variables that are needed
