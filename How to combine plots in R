# Data frame that contains values I want to plot. In this case, I have 2 groups and I want to plot
# the medians and their confidence intervals (variables upper and lower):

df1 <- data.frame(group= c("Group1","Group2"), median = c(y,y),
                      lower = c(y,y), upper = c(y,y))

# GGplot for bar graph:

graph1 <- ggplot(data=df1, aes(x=group, y=median, fill=group)) +
  geom_bar(data=df1, mapping=aes(x=group, y=median), stat = "identity", width =.5, color = "black") +
  geom_errorbar(data = df1, mapping=aes(x=group, ymin=upper, ymax=lower), color = "black", width = .2) +
  theme_bw() ; graph1

 # The three plots fell in love because they are so beautiful. So they decide to have a wonderful polyamorous relationship
 # BUT! They live in separate worlds. Let's bring them together so that they can finally do the dirty:
 
 install.packages("ggpubr")
 library(ggpubr)
 
 # I have no idea what rremove() does, but it didn't matter if it was there or not so there you go. 
 
ggarrange(graph1, graph2, graph3 + rremove("x.text"),
          labels = c("A","B","C"),
          ncol = 2, nrow = 2, align = "v") # align = "v" aligns the graphs' axes vertically
          
          
 ##### This is a graph to compare two regresion lines. Useless shit I needed for EPIB 705 that took me forever to find:
 
 plot <- ggplot(data=q2data, aes(x = agediag, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, color = "grey") +
  geom_abline(intercept = reg$coefficients[1], slope = reg$coefficients[2], show.legend = TRUE, color = "#0000FF", size = 1) +
  geom_abline(intercept = reg2$coefficients[1], slope = reg2$coefficients[2], show.legend = TRUE, color = "#FF0000", size = 1) +
  labs(y = "Weight", x = "Agediag (blue) and Agebias (red)") +
  theme_classic(); plot
